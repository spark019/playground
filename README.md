# Playground

Welcome to my coding playground — a collection of coding exercises, experimental projects, and small-scale prototypes.  
This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring programming concepts, frameworks, and best practices while sharpening problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

- **Experimentation** — Test out ideas, libraries, and programming concepts.
- **Skill Demonstration** — Showcase problem-solving abilities and coding style.
- **Continuous Learning** — Refine techniques and explore new technologies.
